## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd ML_CODES1/ML_CODES/FINAL/ML
```

3. Open the desired Jupyter notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook <notebook_name>.ipynb
```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to train or test the models using the provided datasets.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in the notebooks)

## Notes

- Ensure that all the necessary Python packages are installed before running the notebooks.
